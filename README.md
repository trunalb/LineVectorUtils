A simple library that helps you find points on a given line, if you know
ONE of the following
:

1. The slope of the line and a point on the same line
2. Two points on the line

It uses vector algebra and therefore is much intuitive to use. Look in the .h file for the entire API.

I used it while building the "throw away" photo animation for the Tempt app
(https://www.tempt.com/). Code is released under the MIT license so feel free to use it the way you
want!
